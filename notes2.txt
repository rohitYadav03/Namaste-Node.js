1. Server
A server is a remote computer that provides data, services, or resources to clients over a network. Clients send requests to the server's IP address, and the server responds accordingly.

2. IP Address
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It facilitates the routing of data between clients and servers.

Private IP: Used within local networks (e.g., 192.168.x.x).

Public IP: Assigned by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and used for communication over the internet.

3. V8 Engine
The V8 engine is Google's open-source, high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It compiles JavaScript into machine code, enabling efficient execution. V8 can be embedded into any C++ application, allowing developers to run JavaScript outside the browser environment.

4. Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code server-side, enabling the development of scalable network applications. Node.js provides additional APIs for file system access, networking, and more, extending JavaScript's capabilities beyond the browser.

5. ECMAScript
ECMAScript is the standardized specification that JavaScript adheres to. It ensures consistency across different JavaScript engines like V8, SpiderMonkey, and JavaScriptCore.

6. JavaScript Runtime
A JavaScript runtime combines a JavaScript engine (like V8) with additional APIs to provide a complete environment for executing JavaScript code. For instance, Node.js includes V8 and adds APIs for server-side functionalities.

7. Low-Level Code
Machine Language: Binary code (0s and 1s) directly executed by the CPU.

Assembly Language: A human-readable representation of machine code, closely tied to the hardware's instruction set.

ðŸ§© How These Concepts Interconnect
V8 Engine: Compiles and executes JavaScript code efficiently.

Node.js: Utilizes the V8 engine to run JavaScript on the server-side, providing additional APIs for extended functionalities.

ECMAScript: The standard that ensures JavaScript code behaves consistently across different environments.

JavaScript Runtime: The combination of a JavaScript engine and additional APIs, forming a complete environment for executing JavaScript code.

IP Addresses: Facilitate communication between clients and servers over a network.

Servers: Machines that respond to client requests, often utilizing runtimes like Node.js to handle operations.
