 ------------------------------------- Namaste Node.js ---------------------------------

Episode 1 :-

Definition: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine, enabling JavaScript outside the browser (servers, desktops, embedded). Event‑driven, non‑blocking I/O.

2009: Created by Ryan Dahl. Initially tried SpiderMonkey, switched to V8 for speed.

Joyent: Hired Dahl shortly after release; provided funding and infrastructure.

Name Change: Originally “Web.js,” renamed to “Node.js” to reflect broader use beyond web servers.

2010 (Jan): npm launched by Isaac Schlueter—standardized module sharing and dependency management.

2011 (July): First official Windows build (previously Linux/macOS only).

2012: Dahl steps back; Isaac Schlueter becomes project lead under Joyent’s sponsorship.

2014 (Dec): io.js fork emerges, seeking faster V8 upgrades and open governance.

2015 (Feb–Sep): Node.js Foundation formed; io.js and Node.js merge into Node v4.0.0 under unified governance.

2019: Node.js Foundation merges with JS Foundation to create the OpenJS Foundation, now overseeing Node.js and related projects.

Today (mid‑2025): Actively maintained by the OpenJS Foundation; LTS releases on even‑numbered versions; npm registry hosts millions of packages; widely used in web services and microservices.
